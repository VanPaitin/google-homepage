# Google Homepage

This is a clone of the [Google](https://google.com) home page. The motivation for this project is the learning of front end technologies like HTML and CSS. The journey was fulfilling and the learning was very eventful. I learnt many tricks but most importantly, I became more comfortabe with css and styling html elements
